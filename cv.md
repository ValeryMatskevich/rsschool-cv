## Code Example:
Task:  
The simplest spell-checking system can be based on using a list of known words. If the entered word is not found in this list, it is marked as "error".  
Let's try to write a similar system.  
The number of words known to us is transmitted to the program in the form of the first line, after which these words are indicated on the lines. Then the number of l lines of text to check is passed, followed by l lines of text.  
Output unique "errors" in any order. Do the work case-insensitive.
```Python
Slovar = set(input().lower() for i in range(int(input())))
D = [input().lower().split() for j in range(int(input()))]
result = set()
for i in D:
    for j in i:
        if j not in Slovar:
            result.add(j)
for elem in result:
    print(elem)
```
